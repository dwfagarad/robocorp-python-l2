Python - Minimal
This template leverages the new Python open-source structure robo, the libraries from to same project as well. The full power of rpaframework is also available for you on Python as a backup while we implement new Python libraries.

The template provides you with the basic structure of a Python project: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without fiddling with the base Python stuff. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away.

ðŸ‘‰ After running the bot, check out the log.html under the output -folder.

The template here is essentially empty, leaving you with a canvas to paint on.

Do note that with Robocorp tooling you:

Do NOT need Python installed
Should NOT be writing pip install..; the conda.yaml is here for a reason.
You do not need to worry about Python's main -functions and, most importantly, the logging setup
ðŸš€ Now, go get'em
